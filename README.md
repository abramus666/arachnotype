# Arachnotype

This is a game I made with an extra goal in mind of improving my touch typing skills.

Your objective as a player is to stop spider invasion. The gameplay boils down to shooting spiders by typing words displayed underneath them. The longer the word, the "tougher" the spider is. If you allow a spider to come near you, it can hurt and possibly even kill your character. On the other hand, you can increase your hit points by not making a single mistake for a number of consecutive shots. With time, more and more spiders come, and they get tougher. If you survive long enough, there's a boss to be defeated...

There is also an editor for 2D vector models, which was used to create graphics for the game. The editor has no menu or buttons, its interface is based on keyboard shortcuts and text commands. Pressing F1 shows a brief description of the interface.

Both game and editor are coded in Python and use tkinter for graphics and input.
